Lets bring this function to life!

## Echo Dot

Plug in the Echo Dot - it should get a soothing orange ring action going!

Open the Alexa App and login, you should see the following screen if this is your first time, click 'Continue':

Select 'Echo Dot' from the list:

Select your language and click 'Continue':

When the Echo Dot has the organge ring, click 'Continue':

I've always had to be prompted to manually connect to my Echo Dot's wifi - so go to your wifi settings now:
![Echo Dot Setup](../images/Echo%20Setup%20-%2005.png)

You should see Amazon-XXX on the list (or maybe multiple during this hackathon :) ) - connect to it! Dismiss any warnings about not having internet access on it:

Switch back to the Alexa App and we should be connected now! Click 'Continue':
![Echo Dot Setup](../images/Echo%20Setup%20-%2007.png)

Now we have to connect the Echo Dot to the wifi - select your wifi point from the list:
![Echo Dot Setup](../images/Echo%20Setup%20-%2008.png)

If its a private wifi point, you may be asked for a username and/or password now, or it may bring you to a portal to complete the login:

The Echo Dot will lie to you and claim Setup is complete.. but you still have to click 'Continue' :)

Click 'No speakers' from the list:
![Echo Dot Setup](../images/Echo%20Setup%20-%2011.png)

Click 'Continue' as your name should already match your Alexa login:

Click 'Allow' under permissions:
![Echo Dot Setup](../images/Echo%20Setup%20-%2013.png)

For SMS setup I just hit 'skip' in the top right:
![Echo Dot Setup](../images/Echo%20Setup%20-%2014.png)

Sadly this part you can't skip - you need to watch the Echo Dot introduction video:
![Echo Dot Setup](../images/Echo%20Setup%20-%2015.png)

Once you are finished watching it, click 'Next':
![Echo Dot Setup](../images/Echo%20Setup%20-%2016.png)

Click through the final few screens where example commands are suggested:
![Echo Dot Setup](../images/Echo%20Setup%20-%2017.png)

And finally we are actually done and can click 'Go To Home':

## Alexa App - Our Skill

Click the menu icon in the top left:
![Alexa App Home Screen](../images/Alexa%20App%20-%2001%20-%20Home%20Screen.png)

Click the 'Skill' menu item:
![Alexa App Menu](../images/Alexa%20App%20-%2002%20-%20Menu.png)

Click the 'X' in the top corner of this pop-up, it only appears the first time you enter the Skill section:
![Alexa App Menu](../images/Alexa%20App%20-%2003%20-%20Skill%20Popup.png)

This shows all the skills available to download, but we want to get to our skill we just developer, this is in the 'Your Skills' section in the top right:
![Alexa App Menu](../images/Alexa%20App%20-%2004%20-%20All%20Skills.png)

This is all of the skills already installed, but we haven't released our new skill yet. Thankfully it should be available under the 'Dev Skill' section:
![Alexa App Skill List](../images/Alexa%20App%20-%2005%20-%20Skill%20List.png)

Excellent! We have our skill already on the phone! Click the skill to confirm it is enabled:
![Alexa App Dev Skill List](../images/Alexa%20App%20-%2006%20-%20Dev%20Skill%20List.png)

Awesome, at this point we are ready to hook up the Echo Dot and execute the skill:
